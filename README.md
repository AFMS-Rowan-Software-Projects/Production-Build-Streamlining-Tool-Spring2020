# Production-Build-Streamlining-Tool-Spring2020
The software ASRC Federal Mission Solutions delivers is very large and complex. The build scripts and makefiles used to generate the software are often very complicated and include many unnecessary library paths. This creates inefficiencies in the build process and adds time to our delivery process. The team will create a tool to identify the extraneous include paths in the makefiles to ensure that only the required paths are included in the build. The tool will ensure the makefile or build script include paths contain only the necessary library paths as required by the component being built. This tool will make our build and unit test process more efficient.
